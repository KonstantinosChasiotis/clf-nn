% \begin{itemize} 
% 	\item The hard page limit is 7 pages in this style. This excludes references and excludes the short, mandatory part on individual contributions (see end). 
% 	\item No appendix. 
% 	\item Do not reduce font size or use other tricks to squeeze. 
% 	\item The pdf is formatted in the American letter format, so may look a bit strange when printed out (and there is no real reason to do this).
% \end{itemize}

\begin{abstract}
Describe in concise words what you do and the main result. The abstract has to be
self-contained and readable for a person in the general area. Write the abstract last and keep it short.

\section{Contributions of Team Members (Mandatory)}

\mypar{Example} Focused on non-SIMD optimization for the variant 2 of the algorithm. Cache optimization, basic block optimizations, small generator for the innermost kernel (Section 3.2). Roofline plot. Worked with Francois on the SIMD optimization of variant 1, in particular implemented the bit-masking trick discussed.

% \section{Background on the Algorithm/Application}\label{sec:background}

% Give a short summary on the algorithm or application that you then later optimize. Show some of the key parts or equations. Then define the cost measure and show the cost analysis that you later use to create performance plots.

% This section should end well before the end of page 2.

% HERE THE SECTIOS I COMMENDED OUT : \section{Optimization Performed}\label{sec:yourmethod}

% Now comes the ``beef'' of the paper, where you explain what you
% did. Again, organize it in paragraphs with titles. As in every section
% you start with a very brief overview of the section.

% For this course, explain all the optimizations you performed. This mean, you first very briefly
% explain the baseline implementation, then go through locality and other optimizations, and finally SSE (every project will be slightly different of course). Show or mention relevant analysis or assumptions. A few examples: 1) Profiling may lead you to optimize one part first; 2) bandwidth plus data transfer analysis may show that it is memory bound; 3) it may be too hard to implement the algorithm in full generality: make assumptions and state them (e.g., we assume $n$ is divisible by 4; or, we consider only one type of input image); 4) explain how certain data accesses have poor locality. Generally, any type of analysis adds value to your work.

% As important as the final results is to show that you took a structured, organized approach to the optimization and that you explain why you did what you did.

% Mention and cite any external resources including library or other code.

% Good visuals or even brief code snippets to illustrate what you did are good. Pasting large amounts of code or screen shots to fill the space is not good.

% \section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:exp}

% Here you evaluate your work using experiments. You start again with a
% very short summary of the section. The typical structure follows.

% \mypar{Experimental setup} Specify the platform (processor, frequency, cache sizes)
% as well as the compiler, version, and flags used. I strongly recommend that you play with optimization flags and possibly compilers, even though this can only be a minor aspect in the project and report.

% Then explain what input you used and what range of sizes. Go large enough so the computations takes a few minutes or ideally even longer.

% \mypar{Results}
% Next divide the experiments into classes, one paragraph for each. In the simplest case you have one plot that has the size on the x-axis and the performance on the y-axis. The plot will contain several lines, one for each relevant code version. Discuss the plot and extract the overall performance gain from baseline to best code. Also state the percentage of peak performance for the best code. Note that the peak may change depending on the situation. For example, if you only do additions it would be 12 Gflop/s
% on one core with 3 Ghz and SSE and single precision floating point.

% Do not put two performance lines into the same plot if the operations count changed significantly (that's apples and oranges). In that case, for example, first perform the optimizations that reduce op count and report the runtime gain in a plot. Then continue to optimize the best version and show performance plots.

% {\bf You should}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Follow to a reasonable extent (i.e., don't stress out about it) the guide to benchmarking presented in class, in particular
% \item plots should be very readable (do 1 column, not 2 column plots
% for this class), including the font size. An example is below (of course you can have a different style),
% \item every plot answers a question, which you pose and extract the
% answer from the plot in its discussion
% \end{itemize}
% Every plot should be referenced and discussed (what does it show, which statements do
% you extract).

% Most important: Be analytical about your results. Explain them as good as possible and in the end try to argue why more performance is not possible. Read the FAQs (How the project is graded) on the website.


% \section{Conclusions}

% Here you need to briefly summarize what you did and why this is
% important. {\em Do not take the abstract} and put it in the past
% tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the paper, so it
% is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight
% important results and say the things you really want to get across. Be brief.

% \section{Further comments}

% Here we provide some further tips.

% \mypar{Further general guidelines}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item For short papers, to save space, I use paragraph titles instead of
% subsections, as shown in the introduction.

% \item It is generally a good idea to break sections into such smaller
% units for readability and since it helps you to (visually) structure the story.

% \item The above section titles should be adapted to more precisely
% reflect what you do.

% \item Each section should be started with a very
% short summary of what the reader can expect in this section.

% \item Do not use subsubsections.

% \item Make sure you define every acronym you use, no matter how
% convinced you are the reader knows it.

% \item Always spell-check before you submit.

% \item Be picky. When writing a paper you should always strive for 
% high quality. Many people may read it and the quality makes a big difference.
% In this class, the quality also contributes to the grade.

% \item Books helping you to write better: \cite{Higham:98} and \cite{Strunk:00}.
% \end{itemize}

% \mypar{Graphics} Fig.~\ref{fftperf} is an example plot that I used in a lecture. Note that the fontsize in the plot should not be any smaller. On the other hand it is also a good rule that the font size in the plot is not larger than the one in the caption (otherwise it looks ugly).

% \begin{figure}\centering
%   \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{dft-performance.pdf}
%   \caption{Performance of four single-precision implementations of the
%   discrete Fourier transform. The operations count is roughly the
%   same. {\em The labels in this plot are about the smallest you should go.}\label{fftperf}}
